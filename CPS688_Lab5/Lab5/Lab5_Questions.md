Lab Instructions:

Problem 1 – Boyer-Moore Substring Search-----------------------------------------------------------

Implement the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm in Java.

Input
Your program will be tested against multiple test cases. Each test case includes the text and the
pattern.

Output
For each test case, determine the position(s) of the pattern(s) found in the text.

Sample Input
Enter the text: Hello World
Enter the pattern: World

Sample Output
Pattern World found at index 6
________________________________________
Sample Input
Enter the text: ATAACGGCTAATA
Enter the pattern: ATA

Sample Output
Pattern ATA found at indices 0, 10

Problem 2 – Rabin-Karp Substring Search------------------------------------------------------------

Implement the Rabin-Karp substring search algorithm in Java (Las Vegas version, see lecture
notes for details). Test your program as you did in Problem 1.
